# Challenge 3 – Docker Deployments

## Overview

This challenge focuses on deploying **two different web applications** using **Docker and Docker Compose** in a production-like setup.  
Each project uses a different technology stack, and both applications are required to run **simultaneously** on the local machine using isolated Docker containers.

The goal of this challenge is to understand:
- Containerization of frontend and backend services
- Multi-container orchestration using Docker Compose
- Secure networking between containers
- Handling real-world dependency and build issues
